Via the screen options menu that you can display on the edit post page by clicking the tab in the top right hand corner.

Yes, AJAX Contact supports both honeypot anti-bot validation and Google's ReCAPTCHA.

= I cant get the email to send or change the from address =

You may be having trouble sending emails due to hosting restrictions, you might try installing <a href = 'http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/wp-mail-smtp/screenshots/' >WP Mail SMTP</a> and setting up a SMTP account for WordPress to use for sending emails.  In some instances users have found installing WP Mail SMTP and configuring an SMTP account fixed the problem.
